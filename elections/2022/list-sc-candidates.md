| Alexandre Eichenberger  | IBM  | At IBM, I am the lead of the ONNX-MLIR project which translates ONNX models into executable binaries targeting x86 (Linux, MacOS, Windows) as well as POWER and Z servers (which now include an AI Hardware accelerator). As a current member of the ONNX Steering Committee, I represent ONNX to the LFAI TAC committee and helped shepherd last yearâ€™s ONNX roadmap discussions. I am passionate about the goals of Open Source for AI, where multiple companies with diverse aims collaborate to generate high quality software to advance the state of the art. I look forward to continuing to serve this great community.   |                                                                                               
| Andreas Fehlner  | TRUMPF Laser GmbH  | Since 2010, I have been working on machine learning topics. Through my activities in different professional associations and scientific societies (a.o. Founding member and Vice-Chair of the Working Group on Physics, Modern Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence of the German Physical Society) as well as my industrial work in mechanical engineering in the area of computer vision and edge AI, the problem of getting models from different frameworks to run elsewhere is made apparent to me on an almost daily basis. Onnx is therefore the logical choice for me and I would like to contribute to simplifying and spreading its use even more. |                                                                                                
| Mayank Kaushik  | NVIDIA  | I've been involved with Deep Learning hardware and software for several years, both as an individual contributor and manager. As an early employee at one of the first Deep Learning hardware startups, I helped build the end-to-end software stack and managed a team of software architects. I've also contributed to several layers of the GPU software stack at NVIDIA, from low-level software to the CUDA runtime library and developer tools. I'm presently an Engineering Director at NVIDIA in the TensorRT group. ONNX has huge value for TensorRT and its customers, enabling them to migrate their models across frameworks and deploy their models in a framework-agnostic way. My team is focused on continuously improving TensorRT's ONNX support and helping our customers easily deploy their applications with ONNX, and has been actively contributing to the Operators, Convertors and Models/tutorials SIGs. |                                                                                                
| Amira Moussa  | CheetahAI  | I have been in connection with Jim Spohrer where we have been talking about a project I am working on, where we want to build a translator that converts high-level languages to FPGA hardware code.  |                                                                                                
| Rajeev Nalawadi  | Intel Corporation  | Is a privilege being member of ONNX SC and helping advance the adoption/usage in the industry. Have been part of ONNX standard since inception in 2018 and SC member for period of June 21 to May 22. Contributed to ONNX training operators.     |                                                                                               
| Prasanth Pulavarthi  | Microsoft  | I've been involved with ONNX and have been on the Steering Committee since its inception. My team at Microsoft contributes to all of the ONNX SIGs and also develops ONNX Runtime. We are deeply invested in ONNX and I am excited to continue evolving it and increasing adoption amongst developers and hardware vendors.     |                                                                                               
| Egor Pushkin  | Oracle Cloud Infrastructure  | I'm technologist focusing on highly-distributed systems and adoption of machine learning techniques in cloud space. Most recent efforts of mine are targeted towards making use of various aspects of natural language processing and understanding at AWS and now at OCI where I operate as a Human Language Technologist. My area of expertise covers core NLP, translation, transcription, chat bots, semantic search. I'm a data enthusiast. I believe that evolution of technology is in a sense evolution of data processing paradigms. Handling data and making it useful is the biggest challenge of information technology domain. I build and maintain BlobHub (https://blobhub.io/) - service that positions itself as a home for structured and versioned data. Hosting ONNX models is one of its first class citizen capabilities. |
