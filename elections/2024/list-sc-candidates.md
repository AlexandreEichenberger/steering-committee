I enjoy working for this vibrant community and hope that you will let me continue serving the ONNX community on its Steering Committee. |
| Mauro Bennici	| Intelligenza Etica | My name is Mauro Bennici, and I have been working in the field of applied AI since 2006. I was the founder and CTO of a generative AI startup from 2013 to 2022. I work as a consultant for those realities that need to install models in disconnected devices. I have worked with ONNX and the ONNX development team since its first alpha release. I have brought its use with concrete examples of deployment into production in the Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia communities and the .Net Conference Rome, Big Data Europe, and IT Warsaw meetups. | 
| Andreas Fehlner | TRUMPF Laser AG	| For the past 15 years, my professional journey has been deeply rooted in machine learning, spanning various roles within professional associations, scientific societies, and industry, particularly in computer vision and edge AI. This experience has underscored the critical importance of establishing common standards and minimizing barriers to their adoption. I am deeply grateful for the work undertaken by the ONNX community and am eager to further contribute by serving on the Steering Committee. In my role as an approver within the Models and Tutorials SIG, I am committed to enhancing accessibility to valuable information, a task that involves spreading information on linkedin/twitter(X), revising content on GitHub, maintaining and augmenting resources on YouTube, and fostering smoother collaboration within the community, including facilitating the transition to the LFX system, the new collaboration platform from the Linux Foundation. Moreover, I proudly represent ONNX within the Technical Advisory Council of LF AI & Data and organize the election process. As one of the chairs of the Responsible AI Committee and a member of AI/ML security-related committees within LF AI and OpenSSF, I am dedicated to identifying synergies across diverse communities. This commitment extends to implementing good practices from OpenSSF and enhancing supply chain security through initiatives such as SLSA and sigstore.

| Mayank Kaushik | NVIDIA Corporation |	I've been involved with Deep Learning hardware and software for several years, both as an individual contributor and manager. As an early employee at one of the first Deep Learning hardware startups, I helped build the end-to-end software stack and managed a team of software architects. I've also contributed to several layers of the GPU software stack at NVIDIA, from low-level software to the CUDA runtime library and developer tools. I'm presently an Engineering Director at NVIDIA in the TensorRT group. ONNX has huge value for TensorRT and its customers, enabling them to migrate their models across frameworks and deploy their models in a framework-agnostic way. My team is focused on continuously improving TensorRT's ONNX support and helping our customers easily deploy their applications with ONNX, and has been actively contributing to the Operators, Convertors and Models/tutorials SIGs. |
| Aishik Ghosh | University of California, Irvine |	I'm a physicist who develops neural-network-based solutions for particle physics and astrophysics. I have led the deployment of models in ONNX format, which are run in independent C++ and python frameworks with OnnxRunTime. I also teach how to use these to physics students. I deployed the first deep generative models in a particle physics experiment (ATLAS) for fast stimulation of our detector in 2018 with LWTNN (of such I'm a minor developer). We are now updating to ONNX. Recently I've deployed it for fast inference in astrophysics. There are certain decisions on reproducibility and interoperability that are essential for scientific applications and I'd like to make sure the right decisions are taken, as a member of the steering committee. |
| Saurabh Tangri | Intel Corporation | Since the beginning of ONNX, I've been deeply involved in its growth, working tirelessly to broaden its reach by collaborating with many companies and onboarding contributors from both small and large corporations. At Intel, my team proudly develops the ONNX and ONNX Runtime Software stack for Intel's PC and Datacenter businesses. Recently, I championed Intel's donation of the Intel Neural Compressor and the formation of a new ONNX optimization SIG, enhancing the community's ability to quickly quantize models. As a current member of the ONNX steering committee, I've fostered collaboration across different LFAI initiatives, including co-chairing the model workstream at Gen AI Commons. Additionally, my contributions to Trusted AI and AI security committees have helped keep ONNX at the forefront of new standardization efforts. Looking ahead, I'm committed to making the ONNX ecosystem the top choice for building and deploying efficient, cutting-edge, trusted, and secure AI solutions in our rapidly evolving landscape. With your support, I'm eager to continue driving ONNX forward and shaping its future together! |
