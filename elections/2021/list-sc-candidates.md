| Brandon Allgood        | Valo Health                                     | I have been working in ML professionally since 2005. I have been focused primarily on healthcare and drug design. I have developed a number of ML model composition, serialization, provenance and metadata frameworks. I am the chair and cofounder of the Alliance for AI in Healthcare and often give talks on FAIR model principles. I want ONNX to grow and become a central player in the ML model ecosystem. I would love to help make that happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Wenming Ye             | Amazon Web Services AI Deep Engine Science Team | As a research product manager at AWS AI (DGL, Autogluon, MXNet, NN Compilers), I strive to focus our teams to serve the research communities with better, easier-to-use AI/ML tools. I am motivated by further strengthening MXNet ONNX connection, expand ONNX to support more popular ML libraries with Autogluon as a frontend, improve the experience of compiler developers who use ONNX as a frontend, and more. I recognize the urgency to remove the technical/man-made barriers, and promote interoperability in the AI tools community.  The next set of AI innovation will happen in industry and science verticals where users are less skilled in using AI tools. Onnx has the vision of breaking down those barriers and surface AI innovations from different AI eco-systems to be utilized by the general science and engineering communities. As a committee member, I would like to help Onnx set the standards for fostering a “culture of working together” that inspires both the AI developer and the growing AI user community.   |
