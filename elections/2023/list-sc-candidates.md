| Alexandre Eichenberger  | IBM  | I would be honored to continue contributing to ONNX Steering Committee. At IBM, I am leading the ONNX-MLIR compiler project, providing directions as well as implementing significant new features. Recently, I have focused on code that increases the common infrastructure to boost the synergies between the several companies that are now contributing to the project. I am leading the weekly ONNX-MLIR meeting between the 5+ companies who are actively contributing to the effort. Recently, I became a co-leader of the newly created SIG-Compiler, a special interest group that will focus on improving the ONNX standard from a compiler’s perspective. I represent ONNX to the LFAI Technical Advisory Council (TAC) and help running the ONNX roadmap and election process.  I enjoy working for this vibrant community and hope that you will let me continue serving the ONNX community on its Steering Committee.  | 
| Saurabh Tangri  | Intel Corporation  | Saurabh Tangri works at the intersection of hardware and software developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions for Intel’s PC and Datacenter businesses. He has 20+ years of industry experience in a spectrum of technical areas and leads a team of architects at Intel. Saurabh is an innovator who holds 6 patents and leads multiple industry initiatives around AI and ML. Outside work, Saurabh likes to do high-altitude hiking, snowboarding, solo backpacking, and overlanding. Saurabh has been contributing to ONNX since its inception by leading various working groups(quantization, edge, etc..). Recently he co-lead the proposal harvesting efforts for 2023 where he along with peers(in SIG and SC) solicited ideas on enhancements to ONNX, for example, newer data types(FP8) and compression techniques(sparsity) that will further proliferate ONNX for Large Language models. He has also started engagements with Trusted AI and ML Security Committees in LFAI to identify opportunities to expand ONNX. He hopes that by staying in a tighter loop with other LFAI security initiatives, ONNX can become the ecosystem of choice for building and deploying cutting-edge, trusted, and secure AI solutions. |    
| Jeremy  | Landscaping  | To learn |    
| Mayank Kaushik  | NVIDIA Corporation | I've been involved with Deep Learning hardware and software for several years, both as an individual contributor and manager. As an early employee at one of the first Deep Learning hardware startups, I helped build the end-to-end software stack and managed a team of software architects. I've also contributed to several layers of the GPU software stack at NVIDIA, from low-level software to the CUDA runtime library and developer tools. I'm presently an Engineering Director at NVIDIA in the TensorRT group. ONNX has huge value for TensorRT and its customers, enabling them to migrate their models across frameworks and deploy their models in a framework-agnostic way. My team is focused on continuously improving TensorRT's ONNX support and helping our customers easily deploy their applications with ONNX, and has been actively contributing to the Operators, Convertors and Models/tutorials SIGs. |
| Prasanth Pulavarthi  | Microsoft  | I've been involved with ONNX and have been on the Steering Committee since its inception. My team at Microsoft contributes to all of the ONNX SIGs and also develops ONNX Runtime. We are deeply invested in the ONNX ecosystem and I am looking forward to evolving ONNX as the AI industry grows rapidly. |    
| Andreas Fehlner  | TRUMPF Laser GmbH  | Since 2010, I have been working on machine learning topics, and through my activities in different professional associations, and scientific societies as well as my industrial work in computer vision, and edge AI, it made me realize how important it is to implement a common standard and to lower the barriers to its application as much as possible. As a current member of the Steering Committee, I help to represent ONNX at the Technical Advisory Council of LF AI & Data Foundation. As one of the chairs of the Trusted AI Committee, I am interested in finding synergies between the Onnx community and the Trusted AI community. I appreciate the work in the ONNX community and would be delighted to continue the work on the Steering Committee. I am making the available information more accessible to interested parties (including by a better landing page of onnx.ai, revising the information at Github, maintaining, and adding videos to youtube) as an approver of the models and tutorials SIG. Furthermore, I contribute actively to the Arch/Infra topics to bring in my interests and knowledge concerning license, DevOps, and security topics (e.g. by introducing the OpenSSF scorecard). Other points of interest that I would like to bring forward and implement include fuzzing, SBOM, and securing the supply chain with p.ex. SLSA. |    
| Christian Bourjau  | QuantCo  | My personal interest in ONNX reaches back around two and a half years when I built a prototype with it for an ML hosting startup. While the startup did not become a reality I joined QuantCo as a data scientist/engineer instead where I was lucky enough to continue working with this fascinating technology. We adopted ONNX at QuantCo approximately two years ago and are deploying it successfully in several major projects. We use ONNX to build large feature engineering pipelines and make frequent use of operators in the `ai.onnx.ml` domain. We see tremendous potential in the technology and are investing in internal as well as open-source tooling (https://github.com/Quantco/spox) to make it more approachable. Our vision is an ONNX-powered ecosystem that provides a development experience that is as easy, fast, and interactive as numpy/polars/pandas but allows for a seamless export of the business logic into an ONNX model. We believe that ONNX is generally on the right path to becoming such a bedrock technology and we would love to contribute to making it a reality. In particular, we have a keen interest in making the standard more precise and to carefully extend it to cover more feature engineering related uses-cases (e.g. datetime parsing and string operations). |
