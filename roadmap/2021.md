# Roadmap for year 2021

Below are the summary of our roadmap discussions during year 2021.

## New operators for data processing to cover ML pipeline (eg: Stringconcatenator, Stringsplitter, Date)
Takuya Nakaike (IBM): [slides](2021-docs/roadmap-1-nakaike.pdf).

## C API for C++ components of ONNX (to assist in wrapper for model checker functionality)
Adam Pocock (Oracle labs): [slides](2021-docs/roadmap-2-3-pocock.pdf).
## Better support for emitting ONNX models from other languages beyond Python
Adam Pocock (Oracle labs): slides included in the above presentation.

## Add meta information in tensors
Martin Croome (Greenwaves): [slides](2021-docs/roadmap-4-croome.pdf).

## E2E pipeline with ONNX operators (include Keras, TF, Scikit-learn/Spark pipeline preprocessing flows) using single graph
Andrew Sica (IBM): [slides](2021-docs/roadmap-5-6-sica.pdf)

## Converters improvement suggestions (tensorflow-onnx, Keras2Onnx) for better graph optimizations
Andrew Sica (IBM): slides included in the above presentation.

## Address gaps with Opset conversions across broad set of models
Rajeev Nalawadi & Manuj Sabharwal (Intel): [slides](2021-docs/roadmap-7-sabharwal.pdf)

## ONNX model zoo example for E2E distributed training scenario of large models
Rajeev Nalawadi (Intel): [slides](2021-docs/roadmap-8-esteves.pdf).

## Define concept of federated learning for ONNX (multi-edge training and model aggregation) 
Rajeev Nalawadi, Rodolfo Esteves (Intel): [slides](2021-docs/roadmap-9-esteves.pdf).

## Improvements to shape inference implementation
Calvin McCarter (Lightmatter): [slides](2021-docs/roadmap-10-mccarter.pdf).

## Introduce ONNX model provenance & security to safeguard against manipulations
Rajeev Nalawadi, Bhargavi Karumanchi, Rodolfo Esteves (Intel) & Andrew Sica (IBM): [slides](2021-docs/roadmap-11-12-karumanchi.pdf).

## ONNX model zoo support for quantized and mixed precision models
