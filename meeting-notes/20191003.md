  Open issues:  
  How to maintain list of Contributors
  Some ideas but needs more refinement: 
  1) Whitelist known Contributors
  2) Have the whitelist Contributors endorse up to x number of developers that has contributed code to ONNX github.
  3) Whitelist the contributor when there is more than 2 endorsement from different already whitelisted Contributors 
  3) Could write a submission form and macro to query the sheet & handle confirmation
