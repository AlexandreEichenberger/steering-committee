* **Edge WG**  
After consultation with Steering Committe, Edge WG members voted to retire the WG due to challenges with the scope and participation.  
WGs are meant to be short term with a specific scope. Itâ€™s completely okay if the conclusion is that the scope is not right or not of enough interest. We can always spin up another WG with the same or different scope when the time is right.
