### Agenda:

* **Website update**   
Website refresh from Microsoft published at https://onnx.ai.  
Seeking to work with Intel to update http://onnx.ai/backend-scoreboard/ look and feel and link from main site too.

* **Edge WG**  
After consultation with Steering Committe, Edge WG members voted to retire the WG due to challenges with the scope and participation.  
WGs are meant to be short term with a specific scope. Itâ€™s completely okay if the conclusion is that the scope is not right or not of enough interest. We can always spin up another WG with the same or different scope when the time is right. 

* **Training WG**  
https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/2314 PR is ready. Arch/Infra, Operator, and Converters SIGs are reviewing.  
Additional docs at https://github.com/onnx/working-groups/blob/master/training/  
Some questions to consider:  
  * What release should this be part of?
  * What domain should the new ops be in?
  * Should training fields be in the same IR?

* **Model Zoo/Tutorials SIG**  
Vinitra Swamy (Microsoft) has volunteered to lead and written a scope doc at https://github.com/onnx/sigs/blob/master/models-tutorials/docs/MissionStatement.md

* **Repo guidelines**  
https://github.com/onnx/steering-committee/blob/master/repo-guidelines-draft.md  
Updated to make it clearer that it has to go through SIG first
Added section for archiving repos

* **LF AI meeting updates**  
Outreach meeting for this month canceled.  
TAC meeting on Thur 1/16 - Dilip to attend.  
As discussed last time, after we've each attended one meeting, we will decide how best to structure participation.

* **LF AI Calendar**

Other SIGs and WGs need to add theirs
