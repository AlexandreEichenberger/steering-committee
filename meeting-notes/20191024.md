### Agenda:

* **ONNX Leaderboard** 
https://github.com/onnx/backend-scoreboard was written long time ago and not updated. Also difficult to add new backends.  
New version is addressed to fix those issues and also be a server-less system so it doesn't need a webservice to be hosted.  
Azure Pipelines run the jobs daily and update the results which are published to GitHub Pages.

* **Foundation decision** 

* **Contributor list**  
  Proposal: 
  1. Start with SIG and WG Contributors and have them endorse new Contributors. 
  2. If there are 2 endorsements, a nomidated contributor becomes a Contributor
  3. If there is 1 endorsement, a nominated contributor can get an endorsement from a Steering Commitee member to become a Contributor. 
  4. If there are no endorsements, a contributor can become a Contributor with 2 endorsements from the Steering Committee members. 

* **Roadmap**
