### Agenda:
* **CLA update**  
[Joe]
* **Election rules update**  
[Harry]
Current thought is to leverage Kubernete's well defined election process. The outline of their election process can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/blob/master/elections.md)

*Summary of ideas based on Kubernetes election process:* 
1. Voting eligibility: Limited to contributors. A contributor is sponsored by 2 approvers from different companies.
2. Candidacy eligibility: Self nomiated, nominated by their company or multiple companies? The election method and schedule need to be changed according to the eligibility. 
3. Election process: [Condorcet ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) using [Schulze method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method). Every contributor indicates numerical preference for candidates. We are limiting one vote per company so we can potentially roll up one ranking per company and re-apply condorcet ranking. 
4. Election officer: Nominate one of the 5 current steering committee members
5. Vacancy: In case a steering commitee member resigns, the next available candidate with the highest rank from the election will replace the predecessor. There shouldn't be more than 1 steering commitee member per company. 
6. Election schedule: 1 month before ONNX workshop Q1/Q2 next year. 
7. Public annoucement: All votes from the election will be published.
