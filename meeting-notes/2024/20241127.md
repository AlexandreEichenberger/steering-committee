#### Administrative
  - Andreas claimed the host key and removed the otter.ai user from the zoom meeting
  - Andreas repaired the community calender link: https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/6528    

#### Observations for the improvement of Onnx (personal opinion of Andreas)
  - The search / consideration of who is responsible for the next release is in itself unnecessary, so far there have only been 4 companies managing/driving the release. I have created a list at https://github.com/onnx/onnx/wiki/Onnx-Release-Manager. One could involve more companies. e.g. AMD?
  - To increase predictability, I would suggest a release cadence like Pytorch https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/RELEASE.md. Certain months in which the aim is to generate a release branch.
  - In my opinion, some of the recent patch releases have been a bit more than patch releases and, from my subjective point of view, one could also have taken the escape to the front.
    
#### Next meeting (2024-12-11)
 - Moderator: Mayank
 - One after, cancel for the rest of the year and rejoin on Jan 8th.
