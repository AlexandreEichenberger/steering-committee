#### Administrative
  - Andreas claimed the host key and removed the otter.ai user from the zoom meeting
  - Bot still not removed

#### Review slides from Alex
  - Alex updated engagement statistics for ONNX repo.
    - The ONNX model zoo only shows 56 models listed explicitly.
    - onnx.ai/models is the main website for models. Some of them are on HuggingFace as well.
    - Alex used a new LFAI Insights tool for dependent repo stars. The total stars number of 40k seems too high.
      - 36k seems to be the right number.
      - Contributors: taken from the main repo. 310 contributors according to GitHub
    - PRs: 3400 from the ONNX repo
    - Papers: Alex looked at new papers from the last 2 years (40)
    - Consider removing the ONNX tools slide
    - Summarized ONNX releases across the past few releases (1.14 - 1.17).
      - This might be too low level for the audience.
      - Alex will rework the slide to be more high level
    - Natalie shared ONNX-GenAI support slide.
    - Talk about contributions from major AI players
      - Mention benefits and not features.
    - Ask related projects to present at the ONNX Committee meeting
