### Agenda:

  #### Community Meetup
  - Do we prefer that it be 9am to 5pm, or can we consider half a day as well? Removing the need for the meeting room to be close the cafe allows us to get a bigger meeting room in another building.
    - What's the biggest #/$ for a half day event? Presentations only, or a working-group style event? 8:30am to 12pm
    - Last time we went from 10am to 4pm
    - Travel bugdets are tight, so there might be fewer attendees.
    - We could ask for pre-recorded presentations
    - Find out if this can be in the second half
    - SIG presentations could be in-person
  - The organizers are insisting on a 30-30 split between NVIDIA employees and external folks, so external presenters + attendees will need to be <= 30.
  - Are breakout rooms a requirement for in-person attendees?
  - Registration page?
  
  #### Annual Elections
  - Nominations are ongoing: everyone from SC applied, plus two other new nomination. Deadline was Friday. 7 nominations so far.
  - Alex sent a slack reminder for nomination; SIG lead to provide emails, Alex to send a message to SIG leads.
  - Nominations upload to github (https://github.com/onnx/steering-committee/blob/main/elections/2023/list-sc-candidates.md) and published at slack
  - List of contributors can be updated till the end of the month.

  #### Roadmap Process
