### Agenda:
  
  #### ONNX 1.13 release
  - Release manager: PrzemysÅ‚aw Wysocki (Intel)
  - release branch has been cut
  - issues filed against converters and ORT to validate
  - target release date is on 12/16 (Friday)
  - planning to do a Release Review video (ongoing)
  
  #### Roadmap process
  - Notice posted to slack channels and emails sent out
  - 2 submissions so far, none since last week.
  - Website updated (Alex) and post on social (Prasanth, done)
   - (Alex/Prasanth) to follow up in January once everyone is back in the office


  #### LFX Platform (Andreas)
  - The Linux Foundation created a platform (LFX Platform) which a) gives insights in to project statistics (LFX|Insights) b) and allows some collaboration.
  -  Andreas got granted the community-program-manager role and has now access the Project Control Center.
  - He would take a look at that. If anyone else is interested and would be interested to look at it, we can also transfer the permissions.
  - Furthermore, there are several regular expressions that are supposed to check if certain information can be found at the githup repo. Probably, it would make sense to deal with the points like a) Governance, b) Roadmap, c) Community meetings, d) License Scanning, e) Dependency update tool, f) Software bill of materials (SBOM).
  - My opinion: it would make sense to change some things to make the information more available to the community.


  #### Clean Ups
  
  - Governance Model 
    1. missing rule(s)
    2. Split document in a) historical and b) current/valid => For newcomers it is difficult to find which WGs and SIGs are active and who leads the respective groups. [We've have different places, where the information is documented, but partly also outdated.]
  - Repo Guidelines 
    1. Are defined in two different files [a) governance readme.md, b) repo_guidelines.md]
    2. Suggestions to update the repo_guidelines:
     * Every repository is owned by a SIG and the Steering Committee is responsible for managing these repos. => Every repository is owned by a SIG or the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is responsible for managing these repos. 
     * Rules for all repos: Must be owned and managed by one of the ONNX SIGs (at the moment the Github Team Steering Committee is admin of 2 public repos...) => Rules for all repos: Must be owned and managed by one of the ONNX SIGs or the Steering Committee
  - Onnx.github.io
    - Clarify responsibility for the onnx.github.io repo. 
    - Suggestion: "Carry over" to the "SIG" models and tutorials, since this group takes care of the outreach or/and newbies. 
    - Pros: Allows interested persons to contribute to the website as committers and also approvers (without being a member of the Steering Committee)

  #### Videos on website (Andreas)
  - Added files needed for GitHub workflow to the webpage, but then realized this won't work
  - Prasanth suggested outputting videos from CI to a subfolder
   - We would like to first get the website running and then setup CI. Andreas already had CI running on the fork.
   
  #### Google Summer of Code
  - should we submit a project?
  - documentation-only projects not allowed
  - might be good opportunity for working groups
  - Andreas shared info on slack channels
    - no reaction so far. Will ask chairs to prod for answers.
    - Alex will look for ONNX-MLIR, Rajeev will ask for Neural Compressor team.
  - Andreas will sync with Prasanth offline
