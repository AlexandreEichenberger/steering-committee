### Agenda:
  
  #### Roadmap process
  - Andreas got access to the onnx-annonce calender and added the remaining 3? roadmap process session to the calender. (Two remainder by email will be sent, 1 day before and 15min before)
  - Not sure, how to handle the two presentations which did not take place in session one? Will they present another day?
  - Second session today: 
  - Andreas sent email to SIG leads to suggest / discuss to add roadmap submission folks to the list of voters
 
  #### LFX / LFX security / Openssf scorecard
  - Coordination with SIG leads regarding changes to create more points in LFX and scorecard still pending.
  - Andreas: no new points. Will evaluate if its practical. Prasanth: we raised our score from 6 to 8. so that was already helpful.
  - Best practises badge: 
    - Andreas got access (or there is the assumption that all people from the onnx organisation have access)
    - Andreas started to update the entries at: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/de/projects/3313?criteria_level=1 in order to get a silver badge but needs help to to fill out / discuss the points there. Would be nice if there is one go through list and discuss the points together. 
  - LFX or https://clomonitor.io/search?page=1
    - both display similar points
