#### ONNX Presentation (Nvidia)
 - [SLIDES](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aP9MXPu7c5SyPVXmNgVwFFyJEsKrY6pVWyRrK8wYZqM/edit#slide=id.g2741ed1d249_0_10)
 - Nvidia facing challenges exporting to ONNX.
 - Customers don't share their production models often so need to improve off-the-shelf experience.
 - Models need to be split(encoder/decoder), KV caching in Python is a problem.
 - [Notes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/release/8.6/demo/HuggingFace#how-to-run-with-k-v-cache) around T5 execution on TensorRT elaborate further on this issue.
 - JAX adoption is significant enough that there is interest/value for an ONNX exporter.
 - Pytorch 2.1 (trending October) should have the new dynamo exporter supported.
 - Adding OPs and review process is slow and takes months.
 - Issues with attribute dependencies.

#### Optimizations SIG proposal
 - Freddy will setup a meeting starting end of August, Freddy will send an announcement and invitation soon.
 - Freddy will provide an update by next week on any issues with permissions/logistics setting up the repo.

#### Multi-Device Working Group proposal
 - Mayank to follow up and provide an update
 - Alex(IBM) will also be contributing to this WG.

#### Next meeting (2023-08-23)
