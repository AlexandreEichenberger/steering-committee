### Agenda:
* **Summer workshop hosted by NVIDIA**  
* **CLA update**  
* **Establish legal submittee**  
* **Guidelines for logos on onnx.ai**  
* **Election rules update**  
The election platform (http://civs.cs.cornell.edu) takes a list of emails as input and has a straight forward interface. However, we cannot use the platform out of box for the ONNX Steering Committee election. Every Contributor gets to vote, but only one vote counts per Member Company. We may need to collect the votes through a certain platform and roll up the results to Member Company level. We could leverage a Python package for our purpose, which also features Condorcet voting with Schultz method (https://pypi.org/project/python3-vote-core/). Additionally we will need a list of ONNX Contributors, their email addresses, and company names. We haven't discussed the candidacy eligibility in our last meeting. 
* **Model zoo and tutorials SIG**  
* **ONNX 1.6 release**
