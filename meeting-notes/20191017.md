  4. If there are no endorsements, a contributor can become a Contributor with 2 endorsements from the Steering Committee members. 

* **Feedback from Michal K. (Co-chair of Operator SIG)**
  1. Regular set dates for ONNX workshop. Hard to coordinate with other events if potential attendees are notified only a month in advance
