### Agenda:

  #### Contributions to ONNX repo (Neural compressor tool)
  - Rajeev (Nvidia) requested another week to investigate the tool (look at the output of the tool for placement and then ask to see if/how to modify it)
  - Prasanth shared a suggested update to https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/community/repo_guidelines.md
     - currently lists that projects should be closely related to ONNX and add value to the ONNX ecosystem. This captures the intent but we can further clarify by adding another bullet: "Applicable and usable by a wide set of ONNX users (for example, support for multiple hardware backends)"
     - have not received any feedback yet
  - (from last time) Alex: suggest to ask Martin Croome (GreenWaves), to get another data point about the feeling of adaptibility/extensibility of Neuronal compressor tool
  

  #### ONNX website updates
  - Multiple new logos added to the website in the past week
  - Desire to update website main page to target 3 audiences (users, framework developers, hardware manufacturers) -> unlikely to start until October
  - Document automation will be worked on more next week; no new updates this week
  - Once basic pipeline setup will look into JupyterBook as proposed by Andreas and sorting the documentation by different opset versions.
  
  #### Annual update to LFAI TAC
  - Confirmed for October 20. Dec
