  #### Prasanth:  Numpy + ONNX interops.
    - Wenming to invite Sheng.
    
  #### Adding Preprocessing and featurization to onnx graph 
    - Alex: IBM has a lot of interest, but it is fragmented. Everyone is depending on Python, etc.
    - Prasanth: a lot of customers are on devices where python is not available. 
    - Mayank: benefits for tensorRT.
    - Prasanth: we should cover 80% of the customer use cases.
    -  Wenming: autogluon features  https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon/blob/master/examples/tabular/example_custom_feature_generator.py 
    
 #### adding operators: speed vs. validation.  
    - Rajeev:  takes 6 months to add new operators, how do we speed things up?
    - Prasanth: balancing validation & shortening the time for adding new operators
    - Custom ops, domains unblocks, but breaks compatibility. 
    - Mayank: These issues are blocking product paths. (alternatives for TRT:  tFtrt for example).
