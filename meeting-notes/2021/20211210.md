### Agenda:
  
  #### Roadmap next steps
  - status of other items not readily known:
    - New operators for data processing to cover ML pipeline (Operator SIG, Preprocessing WG)
    - C API for C++ components of ONNX (to assist in wrapper for model checker functionality) (Arch/Infra SIG)
    - Better support for emitting ONNX models from other languages beyond Python (Arch/Infra SIG)
    - Add meta information in tensors (Arch/Infra SIG, Converter SIG, Release WG)
    - E2E pipeline with ONNX operators (include Keras, TF, Scikit-learn/Spark pipeline preprocessing flows) using single graph (Arch/infra SIG, Models/Tutorial SIG, Operators SIG, Preprocessing WG)
    - Converters improvement suggestions (tensorflow-onnx, Keras2Onnx) for better graph optimizations (Converter SIG, Operators SIG)
    - Address gaps with Opset conversions across broad set of models (Arch/infra SIG, Converter SIG, Release WG)
    - ONNX model zoo example for E2E distributed training scenario of large models (models/tutorials SIG)
    - Define concept of federated learning for ONNX (operator SIG)
    - Improvements to shape inference implementation (Arch/Infra SIG)
    - Introduce ONNX model provenance & security to safeguard against manipulations (Arch/Infra SIG, Models/Tutorial SIG, Preprocessing SIG, training WG, ORT)
    - ONNX model zoo support for quantized and mixed precision models (Models/Tutorial SIG, Operator SIG)

  #### master -> main
  - feedback? None at this time. Will wait a bit more.

  #### Presentation on ONNX Model Metadata & Queries for Provenance & Mixed Precision
    - Propose encoding about provenance using RDF (format) with specialization ontology (FIRnets).
    - Can use an SQL-like queries to locate a suitable model from a model zoo. Has support in TF ecosystems.
      - Most interested in provenance (bias control) and precision (mixed...)
      - Attach metadata to an onnx model. Some fields could be automatically filled by tools.
    - Alex: Can we approach frameworks like Pytorch & Tensorflow to see if they are also interested in this approach. Ideally we reduce the amount of work for convertors.
    - Rajeev: yes, and OpenVino was approach too and they are interested
    - Followup: Mayank, Alex positive. Prasanth suggested to look at fields already present in the ONNX models.
      - Do we want to keep these fields? Rodolfo as long as the ontology is understood, its fine as they can be processed.
  
  #### Next meetings: 
    - moderator Mayank
    - propose to canel after that until 2022.
