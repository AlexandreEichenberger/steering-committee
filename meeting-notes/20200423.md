### Agenda:

* **Community Meetup recap**  
Joe: logistically went well; was worried about it being over zoom  
Harry: reduced time was good; people didn't have to choose between tracks
Jim: quality, pace, # attendees were good; no side conversations that are possible in face to face meetings
Prasanth: overall went well; agree that reduced time made speakers more focused; can have china-friendly
