### Agenda:
 
  #### ONNX YouTube
  - Prasanth investigated and we cannot move videos from LFAI to ONNX without re-uploading, however we can create playlist on ONNX channel that includes LFAI videos - this has been done.
 
  #### Roadmap next steps
  - status of other items not readily known:
    - New operators for data processing to cover ML pipeline (Operator SIG, Preprocessing WG)
    - C API for C++ components of ONNX (to assist in wrapper for model checker functionality) (Arch/Infra SIG)
    - Better support for emitting ONNX models from other languages beyond Python (Arch/Infra SIG)
    - Add meta information in tensors (Arch/Infra SIG, Converter SIG, Release WG)
    - E2E pipeline with ONNX operators (include Keras, TF, Scikit-learn/Spark pipeline preprocessing flows) using single graph (Arch/infra SIG, Models/Tutorial SIG, Operators SIG, Preprocessing WG)
    - Converters improvement suggestions (tensorflow-onnx, Keras2Onnx) for better graph optimizations (Converter SIG, Operators SIG)
    - Address gaps with Opset conversions across broad set of models (Arch/infra SIG, Converter SIG, Release WG)
    - ONNX model zoo example for E2E distributed training scenario of large models (models/tutorials SIG)
    - Define concept of federated learning for ONNX (operator SIG)
    - Improvements to shape inference implementation (Arch/Infra SIG)
    - Introduce ONNX model provenance & security to safeguard against manipulations (Arch/Infra SIG, Models/Tutorial SIG, Preprocessing SIG, training WG, ORT)
    - ONNX model zoo support for quantized and mixed precision models (Models/Tutorial SIG, Operator SIG)

  #### master -> main
  - feedback?
