#### ONNX Community Meetup 2025
- Original plan for Intel to host ONNX Meetup on April 21st at Intel Santa Clara campus.
- Problems getting support from LFAI event team
- Will use Intel's event systems if LFAI cannot help
- Should find a new date:
  - no save-the-date or RFP sent yet
  - Scheduling conflict for Microsoft attendees
- Now targeting early June
  - Lock date by next week
  - Work backwards schedule for RFPs, registrations, etc
  - Will announce on mailing lists, Slack, social media, website

#### SIG Lead meetings
 - Originally planned to do SIG lead mtgs with steering committee before the community mtg
 - Since community mtg moved out, have the SIG lead reviews in March
 - Instead of one-off meeting, use existing Steering Committee meetings
 - Krishna had previous offered to coordinate the mtgs - Prasanth to follow up with him
 - SIGs should cover updates, highlights, learnings, help needed

#### Growing ONNX with evolving needs
 - Discussion last time with Rama about the issues around ONNX model with custom ops, and the desire to be more nimble with new operations esp with regards to LLM operations.
 - Models that use ORT-specific ops -> would be better to have a path to standardization
 - Core LLM ops have been added to ONNX standard and merged into next ONNX release
 - ORT Model Builder produced models may be more problematic than other converted models

#### Steering Committee Elections
 - Nominations open on first Monday of April
 - Election starts on first Monday of May
