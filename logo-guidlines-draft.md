Member Companies have their logos listed on the onnx.ai website.

The governance defined Member Companies: Member Companies are organizations that support ONNX. They generally fund people to work on the project and resources for running the project, their logos are displayed on the website and other materials, and they sometimes help host community events. Member companies do not have any voting rights, except via their employees who are Contributors. Affiliates and subsidiaries are considered part of the Member Company and not as separate organizations. Being a Member Company does not by itself confer any compliance or certification to the Member Company's products.

In order to be a Member Company the following requirements must be fulfilled:
* Provide written permission indicating the logo can be used on the onnx.ai website as well as in presentations showing ONNX Member Companies
* Provide a high quality logo file with transparent background
* Have done one or more of the following:
  * Have employees participating in SIGs, Working Groups, or Steering Committee
  * Have hosted a workshop or meetup for ONNX
  * Provided resources for building or hosting ONNX assets
  * Have done media or PR activities to promote ONNX
  * Have a product that supports ONNX
  
Member Companies may ask for their logo to be removed at any time and their status as Member Company rescinded.
The Steering Committee also can vote to remove a Member Company of their status.
